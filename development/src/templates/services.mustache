                    <li>Never leave the eye in a piece of tissue. This is the easiest way to lose it. If you swim, while diving underwater, keep your eyes closed. Watch out for the surf when swimmimg in the ocean. Goggles are a good idea.</li>
                    <li>Use only recommended cleaner and water in cleaning the prosthesis, unless otherwise directed by your Doctor or Ocularist.</li>
                    <li>Always wipe the eye towards the nose, wiping outward can dislodge it or cause it to come out.</li>
                    <li>Always practice extreme cleanliness when handling your prosthesis.</li>

                    <li>Consult your Doctor or Ocularist immediately if trouble arises.</li>
                    <li>Have your sighted eye checked regularly by your Opthalmologist.</li>
